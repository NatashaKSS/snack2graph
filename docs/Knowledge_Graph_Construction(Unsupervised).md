# Microsoft GraphRAG Implementation Strategy: Key Concepts and Step-by-Step Approach

## Core Principles

GraphRAG represents a **hybrid semi-supervised approach** that elegantly balances structure with discovery. Unlike the 'supervised' approach that relies on a handcrafted ontology, Microsoft's GraphRAG approach uses **minimal upfront schema definition** while leveraging LLMs for automated entity and relationship discovery.[^1]

The key insight is using **graph modularity** - the natural tendency of knowledge graphs to form communities of related entities - as the foundation for scalable summarization rather than relying on predefined hierarchical structures.

## Multi-Stage Implementation Pipeline

### Stage 1: Source Documents → Text Chunks

**Concept**: Optimize chunk size for entity extraction recall vs. computational efficiency.

**Implementation Strategy**:

- Use **600-token chunks with 100-token overlaps** (Microsoft's optimal configuration)
- The paper demonstrates that smaller chunks (600 tokens) extract almost **twice as many entity references** compared to larger chunks (2400 tokens)[^1]
- Balance recall degradation from longer LLM context windows against computational costs

**Code Pattern**:

```python
from llama_index.core.node_parser import SentenceSplitter
splitter = SentenceSplitter(
    chunk_size=600,  # Optimal for entity recall
    chunk_overlap=100,
)
nodes = splitter.get_nodes_from_documents(documents)
```

### Stage 2: Text Chunks → Element Instances

**Concept**: Multi-round entity and relationship extraction with "gleaning" to improve recall.

**Key Innovation - The Gleaning Process**:
Microsoft introduces a **multi-stage gleaning approach** where the LLM is asked to assess if all entities were extracted, then encouraged to find missed entities in subsequent rounds. This allows larger chunk sizes without quality degradation.[^1]

**Implementation Strategy**:

- Use domain-tailored **few-shot examples** rather than comprehensive ontologies
- Implement **logit bias of 100** to force yes/no decisions on extraction completeness
- Extract entities, relationships, and **claims** (supporting evidence) in parallel
- Use multiple extraction rounds (0-3 gleanings based on dataset complexity)

**Prompt Structure**:

```python
# Primary extraction prompt
entity_extraction_prompt = """
Extract entities (name, type, description) and relationships
(source, target, description) from the following text.
Use these domain examples: [few-shot examples here]
"""

# Gleaning assessment prompt
gleaning_prompt = """
Were all entities extracted? (Yes/No)
If No: MANY entities were missed in the last extraction
"""
```

### Stage 3: Element Instances → Element Summaries

**Concept**: Abstractive summarization of entity and relationship instances into unified descriptions.

**Implementation Strategy**:

- Group extracted instances by entity/relationship identity
- Use LLM to create **rich descriptive text summaries** for each graph element
- Accept some entity name variations - the community detection approach is **resilient to duplicate entities** since they cluster together[^1]
- This differs from traditional knowledge graphs that rely on precise (subject, predicate, object) triples

### Stage 4: Element Summaries → Graph Communities

**Concept**: Use **Leiden community detection algorithm** to partition the entity graph into hierarchical communities.

**Why Leiden Over Louvain**: Leiden addresses Louvain's limitation of potentially disconnected communities by guaranteeing **well-connected communities** through additional refinement phases.[^2]

**Implementation Strategy**:

- Model as **homogeneous undirected weighted graph** where entities are nodes and relationships are weighted edges
- Apply **Hierarchical Leiden algorithm** to create multiple community levels (C0, C1, C2, C3)
- Each level provides **mutually-exclusive, collectively-exhaustive** coverage enabling divide-and-conquer summarization

**Code Pattern**:

```python
# Using graspologic for Leiden community detection
from graspologic.partition import leiden
communities = leiden(graph_matrix, resolution=1.0, random_state=42)
```

### Stage 5: Graph Communities → Community Summaries

**Concept**: Generate **hierarchical report-like summaries** for each community that provide complete dataset coverage.

**Implementation Strategy**:

- **Leaf-level communities**: Prioritize elements by node degree, iteratively add to context window
- **Higher-level communities**: Substitute longer element summaries with shorter sub-community summaries when context limits are reached
- These summaries serve dual purposes: **global dataset understanding** and **query-focused retrieval context**

**Prioritization Algorithm**:

1. Rank community edges by combined source/target node degree (prominence)
2. Add descriptions of source node, target node, linked covariates, and edge
3. Continue until token limit reached

### Stage 6: Community Summaries → Query Answering

**Concept**: **Map-reduce approach** using community summaries as intermediate context.

**Implementation Strategy**:

- **Map Phase**: Generate parallel intermediate answers from shuffled community summary chunks
- **Scoring**: LLM assigns 0-100 helpfulness scores to each intermediate answer
- **Reduce Phase**: Combine top-scored intermediate answers into final global response
- Choose appropriate community level (C0-C3) based on query scope vs. detail requirements

## Key Technical Concepts for Implementation

### 1. **Resilient Entity Resolution**

Unlike traditional approaches requiring perfect entity linking, GraphRAG's community-based approach handles entity name variations naturally. Related entities cluster together even with inconsistent naming.[^1]

### 2. **Hierarchical Query Strategy**

- **C0 (Root-level)**: Fewest summaries, highest efficiency (97% fewer tokens), good for broad queries[^1]
- **C1-C2 (Intermediate)**: Balance between detail and scope
- **C3 (Low-level)**: Most detailed, highest token cost

### 3. **Context Window Optimization**

Microsoft found that **8K token context windows** performed better than larger contexts (16K, 32K, 64K) for comprehensiveness, likely due to "lost in the middle" effects.[^1]

### 4. **Domain Adaptation Strategy**

Instead of comprehensive ontologies, use:

- **Generic entity extraction prompts** with domain-specific few-shot examples
- **Minimal schema constraints** (e.g., "named entities like people, places, organizations")
- **Iterative refinement** based on community summary quality

## Harmonizing with Rule-Based Approaches

GraphRAG provides several integration points for existing rule-based work:

**1. Hybrid Validation**: Use handcrafted ontology elements as **validation criteria** for extracted entities rather than extraction constraints.[^3]

**2. Guided Few-Shot Examples**: Convert ontology concepts into **few-shot examples** for the extraction prompts rather than rigid schemas.

**3. Post-Processing Enrichment**: Apply rule-based relationship validation on the **community summaries** where the scope is more manageable.

**4. Iterative Schema Evolution**: Start with GraphRAG's discovered structure, then **selectively formalize** the most critical patterns as rules.

## Implementation Roadmap

- **Phase 1 - Basic Pipeline**: Implement the 6-stage pipeline with generic prompts
- **Phase 2 - Domain Tuning**: Add your domain-specific few-shot examples and claim extraction
- **Phase 3 - Hybrid Integration**: Layer in selective rule-based validation
- **Phase 4 - Optimization**: Tune community levels and context windows for your use case
